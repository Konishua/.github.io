<h1> Stories about dragons </h1>

<p> In the Far East, the dragon managed to retain its prestige and is known as a beneficent creature. 
  The Chinese dragon, lung, represented yang, <strong> the principle of heaven </strong>, activity, and maleness in the yin-yang of Chinese cosmology. 
From ancient times, it was the emblem of the Imperial family, and until the founding of the republic (1911) the dragon adorned the Chinese flag.</p>

The dragon came to Japan with much of the rest of Chinese culture, and there (as ryu or tatsu) it became capable of changing its size at will, even to the point of becoming invisible. 
Both Chinese and Japanese dragons, though regarded as powers of the air, are usually wingless. They are among the deified forces of nature in Taoism.</p>
